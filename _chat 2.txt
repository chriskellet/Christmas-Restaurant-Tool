[23/10/2025, 10:12:59] Oliver Benn: Chris… where are you with Indian food these days? Was thinking Brigadiers could be good for Xmas dinner but it books up!
Or we go to a ‘suburb’ for better pubs? Notting Hill maybe? Chelsea? Bernondsey?
[23/10/2025, 11:29:32] Alex Mellusco: What happened to Dorchester Grill? 🙂
[23/10/2025, 11:30:43] Oliver Benn: Oh yes
[23/10/2025, 11:30:47] Oliver Benn: Dorchester grill?
[23/10/2025, 13:06:35] Alex Mellusco: The Chinese in Mayfair we all went many years ago is closed now I think? Couldn’t remember name
[23/10/2025, 13:06:47] Alex Mellusco: Menu doesn’t actually look that great
[23/10/2025, 13:58:47] David O'Sullivan: Steak is so last year
[23/10/2025, 13:59:09] Oliver Benn: Sabor?
[23/10/2025, 14:17:52] David O'Sullivan: Have you been?
[23/10/2025, 14:18:14] David O'Sullivan: Is it pseudo Spanish?
[23/10/2025, 14:18:15] Oliver Benn: No but got a Michelin
[23/10/2025, 14:18:23] Oliver Benn: And highly regarded
[23/10/2025, 20:59:49] Chris Kellet: Yeah still not a big fan of Indian food
[23/10/2025, 21:02:04] Chris Kellet: Carbone?
[25/10/2025, 18:40:50] Oliver Benn: Looks good but insane prices for pasta?
[25/10/2025, 18:43:01] Chris Kellet: Yeah I think they left the menu in dollars
[25/10/2025, 18:46:58] Chris Kellet: Seems to be the latest _in_ place to go at the moment. Massively overpriced
[25/10/2025, 18:47:07] Oliver Benn: Crazy pricing
[25/10/2025, 18:48:39] Oliver Benn: What about something more casual/better located for good pubs… like Bermondsey? Soho?
[25/10/2025, 18:49:48] Chris Kellet: Yeah I think that would be better. Doesn’t need to be a blowout. Prob need a new group name though
[25/10/2025, 18:54:21] David O'Sullivan: ‎David O'Sullivan changed the group name to “Cheap trick”
[25/10/2025, 19:00:16] Chris Kellet: Have we pencilled in a date btw
[25/10/2025, 19:00:47] Oliver Benn: Errr

[25/10/2025, 19:03:48] Oliver Benn: I’d prefer a better menu… but I’ll go if everyone else fancies it… can always eat bavette
[25/10/2025, 19:04:47] David O'Sullivan: 8-19 weekdays should all be ok
[25/10/2025, 19:05:01] Chris Kellet: Never been, just looking at new places. This seems new too https://www.bermondseybierkeller.co.uk/

[25/10/2025, 19:09:09] Oliver Benn: I’ve selected weds/thurs but can do any really… mon/tues a bit heavy for work!
[25/10/2025, 19:10:52] Chris Kellet: Yeah weds thurs prob best
[25/10/2025, 19:11:12] David O'Sullivan: Who is +44 7769 682933? It’s some sort of ancient number that seems to be disconnected
[25/10/2025, 19:45:54] David O'Sullivan: Looks like 17th or 18th then
[25/10/2025, 19:46:15] David O'Sullivan: Close enough to lock in a restaurant based on availability
[25/10/2025, 19:46:26] David O'Sullivan: Keep both clear until booked!
[25/10/2025, 20:15:37] Chris Kellet: Trivet has tables on the 17th
[26/10/2025, 03:19:55] Oliver Benn: Back to cheap options 😂
[26/10/2025, 03:20:45] Oliver Benn: I don’t mind…. It’s very good.  Have they pumped prices since they got 2nd star?
[26/10/2025, 05:59:12] Alex Mellusco: https://restaurantstory.co.uk/about-us/? 2* but might not get much back from 350/head+… 🫤
[26/10/2025, 06:18:50] Oliver Benn: I’m open to it… not been before, £275 base menu, so wine plus service got to be heading to £400-450
[26/10/2025, 07:31:48] Charles Wilkinson: Hey Guys,
Just been catching on these messages - been a busy few days.
I can make the Weds or Thursdays work.
Will be nice to catch up :-)
[26/10/2025, 07:34:01] Charles Wilkinson: Are you guys planning on staying the night in the city or aiming for late trains?
[26/10/2025, 07:34:55] Alex Mellusco: I’ll prob stay in city
[26/10/2025, 07:36:47] Chris Kellet: It’s not that much more, tbh no worse than Goodman now. Mains £48-£65, starters are punchy at £39-£43.
[26/10/2025, 07:37:48] Chris Kellet: https://zedwellhotels.com/locations/london/piccadilly-circus/zedwell-capsule-hotel/
[26/10/2025, 07:38:44] Chris Kellet: £2500 bill seems excessive
[26/10/2025, 07:50:10] Oliver Benn: Ok but ends up way cheaper than Story…
[26/10/2025, 07:54:08] Alex Mellusco: Random alt option, high end Chinese https://gouqi-restaurants.co.uk/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=Organic&utm_campaign=GBP-Listing
[26/10/2025, 07:55:57] Oliver Benn: Also good for me
[26/10/2025, 07:56:10] Oliver Benn: Duck and rice also not bad for cheaper option on Chinese..
[26/10/2025, 07:57:02] Charles Wilkinson: I could deffo manage a Chinese. I don't ever get to eat it since Abi hates it.
[26/10/2025, 07:57:25] Alex Mellusco: There’s a duck rice in Battersea power station also (if you don’t mind eating in a shopping centre)

[26/10/2025, 08:05:18] Oliver Benn: Yeh that works for me… not had good Chinese in a while
[26/10/2025, 08:07:07] Oliver Benn: 5 course duck menu 😄
[26/10/2025, 08:08:27] David O'Sullivan: You mean you asked for permission to go out and Abbie suggested you took Juliette
[26/10/2025, 08:10:27] Charles Wilkinson: Confirmed.
[26/10/2025, 08:12:04] Charles Wilkinson: Abi will be 8.5 months pregnant and I've been trying to keep her spending in check recently. She saw the title of this chat when it was called "Blowout" and so it's been something of a tough sell to be honest!
[26/10/2025, 08:12:15] David O'Sullivan: The Thursday will be the better night for me, but the Friday is doable, and I will probably stay over
[26/10/2025, 08:12:37] Charles Wilkinson: I can't do Fridays. I have to be on Dad duty Fridays
[26/10/2025, 08:34:25] Charles Wilkinson: I'll probably need to get a late train home regardless of the day we do. Last one for me leaves at 22.50 from Paddington.
[26/10/2025, 09:01:42] Chris Kellet: What time does that get you home?
[26/10/2025, 09:02:13] Charles Wilkinson: About 1.15 am
[26/10/2025, 09:03:08] Charles Wilkinson: Friday's I'm not working, but have to be back to look after Juliette
[26/10/2025, 09:04:32] Chris Kellet: Not too bad then, and no longer the furthest out of the group
[26/10/2025, 09:05:24] Charles Wilkinson: Yeah. Direct train too, so fairly easy. I just can't miss it, or I'm screwed
[26/10/2025, 09:07:12] David O'Sullivan: Not sure ol can get a train back to Dubai
[26/10/2025, 09:09:00] Alex Mellusco: So Thursday 18th?
[26/10/2025, 09:13:20] David O'Sullivan: Chinese looked good, Korean seems to be the in thing these days though
[26/10/2025, 10:22:06] Alex Mellusco: https://www.sollip.co.uk/about-us-1? Korean
[26/10/2025, 10:25:06] Chris Kellet: I’d vote Chinese over Korean
[26/10/2025, 10:27:03] Alex Mellusco: There’s Chris always talking about the ladies again
[26/10/2025, 20:54:16] Chris Kellet: Need to give fallow another go at some point too
[04/11/2025, 14:07:26] David O'Sullivan: So…
[04/11/2025, 14:07:39] David O'Sullivan: Do we have a consensus on cuisine ?
[04/11/2025, 15:37:34] Oliver Benn: Chinese?
[04/11/2025, 15:39:22] Chris Kellet: Vote? What were the options, Trivet, Gougi, Chicken Cottage, and Story?
[04/11/2025, 15:52:17] Oliver Benn: Want to spend £400/head
[04/11/2025, 15:52:28] Oliver Benn: Seems a bit punchy
[04/11/2025, 15:53:11] Chris Kellet: Story? Or Chicken Cottage?
[04/11/2025, 15:54:04] Chris Kellet: I’d drop Story - too much. I’m happy with either of the first two.
[04/11/2025, 15:59:13] Oliver Benn: Berners Tavern?
[04/11/2025, 17:37:28] Alex Mellusco: Holborn dining room - pre/post drink at Scarfes? https://holborndiningroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HDR-ALC-2710.pdf
[04/11/2025, 17:38:03] Oliver Benn: Not sure a huge fan of the food there but the bar yes
[04/11/2025, 17:38:06] Oliver Benn: Good idea
[04/11/2025, 17:40:38] Chris Kellet: Berners is not bad but prices have gone crazy. Holborn food average last time I went. What about one of the restaurants in the ned?
[04/11/2025, 17:41:23] Oliver Benn: Frankly I’d be happy with decent bbq or similar and a trek around the beer mile pubs?
[04/11/2025, 17:41:24] Alex Mellusco: The steak place at Ned was ok but quite “hushed” if I recall
[04/11/2025, 17:41:44] Oliver Benn: Or trivet
[04/11/2025, 17:42:31] Chris Kellet: Prob steaked out after Goodman
[04/11/2025, 17:42:49] Chris Kellet: Yeah doesn’t have to be a massive meal
[04/11/2025, 17:42:58] David O'Sullivan: Yeah Chinese
[04/11/2025, 17:43:00] Chris Kellet: Cost/size/duration
[04/11/2025, 17:43:23] Oliver Benn: I guess people are going for trains before 11?
